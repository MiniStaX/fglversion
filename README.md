The version control system implemented for Fiber Games Launcher serves as a critical component of our development process, enabling us to systematically manage and track changes made to the software throughout its lifecycle. By maintaining a version.txt file within our GitHub repository, we establish a clear and transparent method of documenting each iteration of the launcher. This versioning system allows us to denote significant milestones, feature enhancements, and bug fixes, ensuring that users can easily identify and understand the evolution of the application. Additionally, the version control system facilitates streamlined collaboration among contributors by providing a centralized platform for version updates and release management. Ultimately, our commitment to effective version control empowers us to deliver a stable and continuously improving experience to our community of users.
